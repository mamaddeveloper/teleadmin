# DLMBot
TelegramBot


## Installing

The python library [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) is required.  

For now, you'll have to create a file named "token" which contains you bot's token.
A file named "updates_log" must be created at the root of the project too.
